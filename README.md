Analyzing email headers can provide valuable information for identifying potentially malicious domains


Open the email: Begin by opening the suspicious email in your email client or webmail interface. Make sure you are in a secure and controlled environment.

Locate the email headers: Look for an option in your email client that allows you to view the email headers. This option is usually found under the "More" or "View" menu. Click on it to display the email headers, which contain technical information about the email.

Identify the "Received" headers: Scan through the email headers to locate the "Received" headers. These headers provide a chronological record of the servers the email passed through before reaching your inbox. The most recent "Received" header is typically at the top, while the oldest one is at the bottom.

Trace the source IP addresses: Start from the bottom of the "Received" headers and work your way up. Look for the IP addresses listed in each "Received" header. These IP addresses represent the servers that handled the email during its journey. Note that the sender's IP address is usually listed in the first "Received" header at the bottom.

Perform IP address lookup: Use a reliable IP address lookup service or website to gather information about each IP address you found in the "Received" headers. These lookup tools can provide valuable details such as the country of origin, the internet service provider (ISP) associated with the IP address, and any known history of malicious activities associated with that IP.

Check domain reputation: If any of the IP addresses are associated with a domain, it's important to assess the reputation of that domain. Several online services offer domain reputation scoring, which can indicate whether a domain is considered suspicious or malicious. Trusted reputation services like Google Safe Browsing, VirusTotal, and URLVoid can provide insights into the domain's reputation.

Analyze email content: While examining the email headers is essential, it's equally important to scrutinize the email content itself. Look for any signs of suspicious or unusual language, requests for personal information, unexpected attachments, or links to unfamiliar websites. Phishing emails often contain red flags in their content that can help identify malicious intent.

Use security tools: To enhance your analysis, consider utilizing specialized security tools or email security gateways that automatically analyze and filter emails for potential threats. These tools employ advanced algorithms and databases of known malicious domains and IP addresses to detect and block suspicious emails.

Report and delete: If you determine that the domain is indeed malicious or the email appears to be a phishing attempt, report it to the appropriate authorities or your organization's IT department. They can take appropriate actions to investigate further and prevent potential harm. Once reported, delete the email from your inbox to avoid any accidental interaction with its contents.
